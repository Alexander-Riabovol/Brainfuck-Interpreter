# Brainfuck Interpreter
_Brainfuck-Interpretator_ is a project that can _execute_ any **brainfuck** code you want.

Moreover, you can _add your own commands_, guiding by initial commands in **commands.go** file.

If you want to execute your own code instead of the '_Hello World!!_', clone this repository and change the code in **main.go** in a line that calls **brainfuck.Brainfuck()** function.
